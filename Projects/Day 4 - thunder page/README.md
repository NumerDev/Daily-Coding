<h1 align="center">Day 4 - thunder page</h1>

Zeus was about to strike me with a thunderbolt but found an old design and decided it would be funnier. I promise to find something for the next week 
that isn't PSD. I think that for this size of project I wrote it more efficiently than the project on day one. (***Numer is improving!*** ðŸ¤—)

**What could have been done better?:**
- ~~Find a better design that is not from 2013~~ Just kidding. The color palette was so spread out for no reason that I decided there was no 
  point in creating a separate file for them so I took them directly from the design
- I know I shouldn't create classes like `bold` so I have to see how to do it better.
