<h1 align="center">Day 1 - warmup</h1>
  
Today I did a ***little*** warm-up. I built a fairly simple landing page using baIt sic stack. The project was not very complicated and gave me an opportunity to try working on prepared designs. It was interesting I will admit. But I find it more pleasant to work on files from **Figma**.

**What could have been done better?:**
- Gulp setup because I forgot to add a task to copy all images etc to the `dist` folder and because of that I had to play with it manually
- Class names... They weren't bad but I always have problems with them
- The ability to worh with photoshop ðŸ˜’ I've nothing against photoshop but... ***Figma is better***


**Wasted cups of coffee**: 1
