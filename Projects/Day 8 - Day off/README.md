<h1 align="center">Day 8 - day off</h1>

I feel like I've been putting too much pressure on myself lately. I haven't found that perfect spot yet but I'm trying. 
Anyway, in order not to break my regularity instead of writing code today I did some research and focused more on reading 
instead of writing code. Also I sent my first application for a developer position which I hope to land 😏
