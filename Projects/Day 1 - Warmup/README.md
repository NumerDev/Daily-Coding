<h1 align="center">Day 1 - warmup</h1>
  
Today I did a ***little*** warm-up. I built a fairly simple landing page using basic stack. The project was not very complicated and gave me an opportunity to try working on prepared designs. It was interesting I admit. But I find it more pleasant to work on files from **Figma**.

**Design**: [[ Here ]](https://symu.co/freebies/templates-4/interactive-agency-psd-template/)

**Stack**:
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)
- Gulp

**Media queries**: nope

**What could have been done better?:**
- Gulp setup because I forgot to add a task to copy all images etc to the `dist` folder and because of that I had to play with it manually
- Class names... They weren't bad but I always have problems with them
- The ability to work with photoshop 😒 I've nothing against photoshop but... ***Figma is better***


**Wasted cups of coffee**: 1
