<h1 align="center">Day 5 - apollo</h1>

Today a lot of things went not the way I wanted. My browser tab has decided to freeze itself secretly on another desktop and slow down everything else ,
everyone needed something from me at the same time and finally I looked for a bug which turned out to be `content` attribute in the pseudoelement 
which was breaking everything on the page 😑 Well... once you **win** once you **learn** 🙇‍♂️

**What could have been done better?:**
- Arrow component for sure because they are terrible and I know
- Separate file for classes like `bold`
- Placeholders in last section. I should use `::before/after` pseudoelements instead of trying to position the placeholder

**Wasted cups of coffee**: 1 🤭

## Next week

I'll start with RWD and animations because I know I'm lacking good media query skills so I'll work on that. 
Anyway, this week has also shown me some of my mistakes in creating layouts which makes me very happy because 
I can correct them in the future 🤞 But now it's time to relax 🤤
