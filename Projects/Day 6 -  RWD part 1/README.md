<h1 align="center">Day 6 - RWD part 1</h1>

Today was a busy day, so I made today's coding a little lighter so I don't strain myself and lose motivation. I started with a little research on
RWD fundamentals and did some small experiments. Tomorrow I want to desing simple layout and test it carefully with media queries and 
responsive elements like fonts or images.
