<h1 align="center">Day 9 - RWD part 3</h1>

Another day focused mostly on reading watching and testing rather than actually writing code but that's ok too.
I've learned about things like `min()`, `max()` and `clamp()` so I'll probably try to apply them tomorrow to create a fluid font and divs.
Today I did some experimenting with images and it turned out pretty good, but I'd like to see how it will work on more complex elements.

**What could have been done better?:**
- I forgot about the missing asset task in gulp file so I have to fix it tomorrow.
- More code! More examples! I basically didn't write anything today X.X

**Wasted cups of coffee**: 1
