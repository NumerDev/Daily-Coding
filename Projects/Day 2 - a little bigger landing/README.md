<h1 align="center">Day 2 - a little bigger landing</h1>
  
I wanted to slow down gently today but in the middle of writing the page I remembered what I had chosen ü§§ BUT... I learned a couple of useful things. 
For example, to check more carefully before coding if certain elements are repetetive and if you can speed up your work by just reusing them aaaaand... 
to take a break sometimes üòè

**Design**: [[ Here ]](https://symu.co/freebies/templates-4/alecto-psd-template/)

**Stack**:
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)
- Gulp

**Media queries**: still nope

**What could have been done better?:**
- Definitely the layout of the page in some sections. I need to recall some of the flex rules for sure.
- **Arrows!** Maybe not better, but they could at least exist there, because now I noticed that I forgot 
  about them both here and in the previous project üí¢
- More scalable elements. I know these first two pages are without media queries but I could have coded it
  better so some things wouldn't fall like dominoes

**Wasted cups of coffee**: 1
