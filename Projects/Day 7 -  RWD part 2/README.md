<h1 align="center">Day 7 - RWD part 2</h1>

Today came the moment when I pretended to be a designer again, this time fortunately with something very simple just to test media queries. 
I began with a bit of an 'adaptive' approach just to try if I would break anything along the way like I did a long time ago. Now I want to change this design so that it will adapt with fonts to any type of screen (***at least to these three major ones***).

**Stack**:
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)

**What could have been done better?:**
- I should set the min and max values of `width` and `height` prevent scaling of elements
- I need to check how flex wrap spacing works

**Wasted cups of coffee**: 1
