### Why am i even doing this?

There are few major reasons:
- I want to fix an old mistake which is not saving my old projects
- With that I'm going to show some of the skills I've learned during my self-study
- And by doing this I will increase my consistency in coding at the same time
- <strike> Well and of course I'll have a place to store my dumb ideas</strike>
<hr>

### So what is going to show up here?

The plan is **simple**. I will start with something simple and gently begin to **raise the bar**. For now I've decided to upload something
from monday to friday. Over the weekend I will be looking for project ideas for the next week and we will see how I progress with it.

### Project structure

Every project will include a **README** with informations about what it contains. For example:
- Tech stack
- Design (optional)
- Whether it has media queries
- What I learned by writing it
- What could have been written better
- Speed coding video ***(maybe)***
- <strike>How many coffees did I drink on fixing something trivial</strike>
